# Domain coloring

This is a Javascript + HTML application to render [domain coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_coloring)
images for complex polynomials.

You can pass a polynomial as an URL parameter, like this:
[http://allanino.me/domain-coloring/?p=z^5-z^2+2z-2*z^3](http://allanino.me/domain-coloring/?p=z^5-z^2+2z-2*z^3).

## Mathematica notebook

We also included a Mathematica [notebook](mathematica/DomainColoring.nb) with functions to render
similar images. This have the advantage of being possible to draw images for a wide range of complex
functions, including the [Riemann zeta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function).

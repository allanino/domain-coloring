# Domain coloring

This is a Javascript + HTML application to render [domain coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_coloring)
images for complex polynomials.

## Current limitations

Below are some limitations we plan to overcome in the future:

- Fixed range from -2 to 2 in both axis
- Broken in Android Chrome

## Mathematica notebook

We also included a Mathematica [notebook](mathematica/DomainColoring.nb) with functions to render
similar images. This have the advantage of being possible to draw images for a wide range of complex
functions, including the [Riemann zeta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function).
